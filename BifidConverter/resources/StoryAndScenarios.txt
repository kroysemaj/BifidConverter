As a GM
I want to be able to easily encrypt messages with half and full bifid ciphers
So that I can create puzzles for my gaming group


Given I have a clue I wish to encrypt
When I supply the program with an encryption algorithm (Polybius Square)
Then the program should return an encrypted string of numbers.
